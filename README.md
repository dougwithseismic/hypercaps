The Keyboard Hack for Windows Users Living at Mach 10

Transform your keyboard into a productivity powerhouse. Born from the frustration of Windows users who needed more speed, more control, and more power than PowerToys could deliver. If you've ever felt held back by your keyboard, this is your nitro boost.

## Why HyperCaps?

Mac users have their Hyperkey. Windows users have... PowerToys? Not anymore. We started with a simple mission to rebind Caps Lock, then realized Windows power users deserved more. Much more. HyperCaps is built for those who type at the speed of thought and need their tools to keep up.

## Features

- **Turbocharged Key Remapping**: Turn any key into your personal productivity accelerator
- **Smart CapsLock Handling**: Because even Caps Lock can be a speed demon
  - Block Toggle: Pure speed, no accidents
  - Double Press: Quick CapsLock when you need it
  - None: Classic behavior with superpowers
- **Zero-Friction Integration**:
  - Silent startup with Windows
  - Instant tray access
  - Lightning-fast keyboard shortcuts

## Installation

```bash
# Coming soon to:
winget install hypercaps
# or
scoop install hypercaps
```

## Usage

1. Launch HyperCaps
2. Choose your trigger key (default: CapsLock)
3. Configure your desired modifier combination
4. Start using your new Hyper key!

## Security

HyperCaps takes security seriously:

- No keylogging
- No network communication (except for future opt-in cloud sync)
- All keyboard processing happens locally
- Open source for transparency

## FAQ

### "Isn't this basically a keylogger?"

Yes, technically speaking. HyperCaps needs to monitor keyboard input to provide its functionality - that's exactly why:

1. We're 100% open source - every line of code is here for you to audit
2. Zero network activity - your keystrokes never leave your machine
3. Minimal data retention - we only track active keys for remapping
4. Local processing only - everything happens on your PC
5. You can build it yourself - clone, audit, and compile your own version

### "Why not just use PowerToys?"

PowerToys is great, but it's limited. HyperCaps offers:

- More flexible key combinations
- Better CapsLock handling
- Faster response time
- Upcoming scripting support
- Focus on speed and power users

### "Will this slow down my PC?"

No. HyperCaps is designed for speed demons - we use:

- Efficient low-level Windows APIs
- Minimal memory footprint
- Optimized event processing
- No background tasks when idle

### "What about gaming?"

HyperCaps can be instantly toggled off with a hotkey, and automatically disables itself when games are in focus (coming soon). No interference with your gaming sessions.
