# Introduction to HyperCaps

Welcome to HyperCaps, the keyboard hack for Windows users living at Mach 10! ðŸš€

## What is HyperCaps?

HyperCaps is a powerful keyboard customization tool designed specifically for Windows power users. Born from the frustration of Windows users who needed more speed, more control, and more power than PowerToys could deliver, HyperCaps transforms your keyboard into a productivity powerhouse.

Mac users have their Hyperkey. Windows users have... PowerToys? Not anymore. We started with a simple mission to rebind Caps Lock, then realized Windows power users deserved more. Much more. HyperCaps is built for those who type at the speed of thought and need their tools to keep up.

## Key Features
