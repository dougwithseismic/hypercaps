## 13-01-2025 - IPC Architecture Rewrite and React Integration Required

### Summary

Initial assessment reveals the need for a comprehensive rewrite of the Inter-Process Communication (IPC) system and proper React integration in HyperCaps. The current implementation lacks proper type safety, state management, and React integration patterns.

### Completed Tasks

- Initial codebase review
- Identified key areas requiring architectural improvements
- Documented current IPC implementation gaps

### Learnings

- Current IPC implementation lacks proper TypeScript type safety across processes
- React components need proper state management integration with Electron
- Window state management needs improvement
- PowerShell script communication could be more robust

### Blockers

None - This is a planned architectural improvement

### Next Steps

- Design type-safe IPC message protocol
- Implement proper React state management pattern
- Create proper window state management system
- Improve PowerShell script communication reliability
- Add proper error handling and logging
- Implement proper event handling patterns

### Technical Notes

- Need to implement proper TypeScript types for IPC messages
- Consider using a state management solution for React
- Improve error handling in PowerShell script communication
- Add proper cleanup handlers for process management
- Consider implementing proper logging system
